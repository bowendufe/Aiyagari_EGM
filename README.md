# Aiyagari_EGM
This repo contains codes to solve Aiyagari Model using the endogenous grid method.
This was done as part of Quant PS for Prof. Bhandari (UMN).

#Note: The code is incomplete and several things needs to be added.

The notes contains a detained explaination of how we go about solving the Aiyagari model. 
It first list down the mehtod for basic aiyagari model with no labor supply.
The method is then applied to model with labor supply.
